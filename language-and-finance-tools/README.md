# Language and Finance Tools ðŸ§ ðŸ’¹ðŸŽŒ

This repository was created out of my passion for learning two key areas: the Japanese language and financeâ€”both essential for my personal and professional growth.

**Why these programs?**

- ðŸŽŒ The **Hiragana Matching Game** makes learning Japanese characters simple, fun, and interactiveâ€”helping beginners memorize hiragana easily.
- ðŸ’¼ The **Financial Vocabulary Game** reflects my interest in mastering crucial financial terms, especially focused on the U.S. market and global finance.

Both projects combine programming with learning, using Python and Tkinter to build accessible and educational applications.

My goal is that these tools help not only me but also anyone who wants to learn Japanese or financial vocabulary in an engaging and straightforward way.
